First things first, I need to decide on the color for my walls and ceiling. I prefer a simple white scheme because I can easily add colors with furniture and lights. To add some character, I plan to buy black brick imitation panels and glue them to one of my walls. For the floor, I'll choose dark grey wood since it's easier to clean in case my cat makes a mess.

Next, I'll focus on lighting. I'll purchase RGB LED strips and PVC panels to create ambient lighting. I'll install them on the ceiling above the brick wall, under my desk, and beside my bed. I'll control the lighting using a remote or my smartphone to change colors.
Moving on, I'll need to buy furniture, all within the same color palette to create a tasteful and organized look. I'll need a couch, coffee table, bed, desk, wardrobe, shelves, rugs, at least two chairs, and a scratching post for my cat to prevent it from damaging my new items.

For electronics, I listen to and produce music daily, so good speakers are a must. A TV is also essential for me as I like to work on my laptop with some background news or entertainment, and I'm a huge movie fan. A printer will be useful for documents. As a coffee lover, I'll need a coffee machine in my room to stay caffeinated. Additionally, I'll have an AC installed for the summer.

To complete the room, I'll purchase a large mirror to check my outfits since I'm into fashion, and it also visually enlarges the room. I'll also add some fragrant candles to keep the room smelling nice.
